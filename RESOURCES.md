## Token Bound (ERC-6551)

**URL:** https://tokenbound.org

**Overview:** ERC-6551 introduces Token Bound Accounts (TBAs), a revolutionary standard that transforms NFTs into smart contract wallets.

By giving NFTs their own wallet addresses, ERC-6551 creates a new paradigm where digital assets can have agency, own other assets, and build rich on-chain histories.
